## AddMaple

[AddMaple](https://addmaple.com) is the no code way to turn your raw data into charts, pivots & reports.

It is built on [these Open Source libraries](https://addmaple.com/open-source).

We have an open source data table built in React and TailwindCSS [here](https://github.com/addmaple/tailwind-datatable)
